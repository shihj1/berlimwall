1945 | The Soviets reach Berlin, and ends World War 2. In this year, the victors (USA, Great Britain, France, Soviet Union) came together in the Potsdam Conference to divide Germany into four parts.
  <hr>
1948 | The Berlin Blockade was set up on June 24. All water/land transit route was removed, this led to West Berlin becoming into a deserted island. This led to the Berlin Airlift on June 26. 
  <hr>
1955 | The allies officially announce their backing out of Germany. West Germany becomes a sovereign state.
  <hr>
1961 | After having 3 Million East Germans leave using the open Berlin Border, Walter Ulbricht of East Germany orders the construction of the Berlin Wall. Early on August 13, troops from East Germany started putting up barb wires, and started constructing concrete wall. The wall surrounding Berlin will extend 165 km (100 miles). See 
<a href="#Map">Map</a> for a map of the Berlin Wall.
 <hr>
1989 | The East German government come under heave pressure from many citizens. Huge anti-goverment demonstrations were held having the slogan "Wir sind das Volk!" (We are the People!) From this, many government officials were forced to resign. Later on this year, in November 9, an East German government spokesman mistakenly announces that citizens of the German Democratic Republic will now be permitted to travel without restrictions â€” effective immediately. It was not the original plan, but the East Berliners took that announcement and swarmed the wall. The wall soon lost effect, was overan, and eventually, completely disappeared.

      <h1 class="w3-center">What does the Wall Symbolize</h1><br>
      <h5 class="w3-center">From 1961 to 1989</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">The Berlin Wall to many was a loss of freedom and human rights; all the sadness, and separation could still be seen through all the rubble that made up the wall. It symbolized 1) What the superpowers of the world at the time (The USSR and the US) thought the world should be led. The West Germans referred the wall as the 'Wall of Shame', whilst the East Germans referred to the wall as the 'Anti-Fascist Wall'. The fall of the wall symbolizes 2) an important event in how the world is today, it showed the supremacy of capitalist government (at the time). 

The wall was the most distinguishable symbol of the Cold War around the globe. Hence why its destruction was treated as a breathtaking scene.

      <h1 class="w3-center">Why?</h1><br>
      <h4>Out of Everything the Soviets could've done, why did they build a wall?</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Between 1949, when Germany was formally divided, and 1961, when the Berlin Wall was built, more than 3 million East Germans moved to West Germany. The rest of the border between East and West Germany had been sealed off in 1952, which meant that the only place in all of Germany where there was a free movement back and forth was Berlin. The East German government never was popular with the people, and the regime never trusted its citizens. Many crossed the border because for economical and political reasons. This meant less educated young youth and educated workers for the East Germans, this had a destabilizing effect on the East German economy. The only way to stop people from continue moving across the border, a wall had to be built. (Trump Wall *cough cough)</p><br>
